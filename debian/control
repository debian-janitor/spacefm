Description: Multi-panel tabbed file manager with built-in VFS, udev-based
 device manager, customizable menu system, and bash integration.
 .
 SpaceFM was developed from a fork of the legacy PCManFM file manager. When 
 PCManFM reached version 0.5.2 (aka 'the legacy version'), the original author 
 (Hon Jen Yee) abandoned it for a major rewrite which made later versions 
 (the 0.9.x series) dependent on gvfs and other components. At about this same 
 time, PCManFM-Mod was created as a minor fork of the legacy version which added 
 features, addressed bugs, and kept the legacy version alive for those who 
 preferred it for its light dependencies and added features.
