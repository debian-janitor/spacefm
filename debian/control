Description: Multi-panel tabbed file manager - GTK2 version
 SpaceFM is tabbed file manager with built-in VFS, udev-based
 device manager, customizable menu system and bash integration.
 .
 SpaceFM was developed from a fork of the legacy PCManFM file manager. When
 PCManFM reached version 0.5.2 (aka 'the legacy version'), the original author
 (Hon Jen Yee) abandoned it for a major rewrite which made later versions
 (the 0.9.x series) dependent on gvfs and other components. At about this same
 time, PCManFM-Mod was created as a minor fork of the legacy version which added
 features, addressed bugs, and kept the legacy version alive for those who
 preferred it for its light dependencies and added features.
 .
 Please install spacefm-gtk3 instead if you want to stick with GTK+3.
