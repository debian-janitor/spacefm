TRANSLATIONS

Translating SpaceFM doesn't require any special tools - just a text editor.
To create a translation of SpaceFM for your language, follow these steps.
    
1)  Install build dependencies, download the SpaceFM source code tarball, and
    extract it (see README - BUILD).

2)  Open a terminal and enter the source code subdirectory 'po'

3)  Generate a spacefm.pot file:

        intltool-update --pot

4)  Create a .po file for your language.  This example uses french (fr) -
    change 'fr' in the examples below to your language:
    
        cp fr.po fr-old.po     # copy the old po file for reference
        cp spacefm.pot fr.po   # create a new po file

5)  Open fr.po in your text editor.  Translate each msgid into the
    corresponding msgstr.  To see examples, consult fr-old.po.  (The program
    poedit has also been suggested as a convenient way to edit po files.)
    
6)  cd into the directory containing configure and run make normally:

        cd ..
        ./configure
        make
        
    If necessary, correct any syntax errors or warnings produced by make
    relating to your .po file and repeat step 6 until make is successful.

7)  Test your translation by installing and running spacefm:

        sudo make install
        rm -rf /tmp/spacefm-test
        spacefm --config-dir /tmp/spacefm-test

    NOTE:  Because of SpaceFM's design mode, your newly translated strings will
    only appear in menu item names when starting with a fresh config
    directory as shown above.

    To start spacefm with a particular locale:

        LANG=fr_FR.utf8 spacefm --config-dir /tmp/spacefm-test

8)  Once translations in menus and dialogs are the way you want them, release
    your translated .po file:

    If you are familiar with github, you can clone the spacefm repo and do a
    pull request.
    
    OR, add the .po file to a public gist https://gist.github.com/ or host
    it elsewhere, then open a new issue asking for your file to be merged into
    the source:  https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/new
    
    OR, email your .po file:  http://igurublog.wordpress.com/contact-ignorantguru/
    
9)  Translated strings will change occassionally as new SpaceFM versions are
    released.  To update your translation:

    Generate a spacefm.pot file:

        intltool-update --pot
    
    Then merge the new strings with the already translated ones:

        intltool-update --dist fr
        
    OR, if you donâ€™t want to overwrite fr.po initially, you can merge into a
    new test file:

        intltool-update --dist --output-file=fr-test.po fr

    Then complete any missing or fuzzy translations in the .po file, and repeat
    steps 7 and 8.
